# 自我介绍
Hi My name is ruanyifeng, but you can call me Ryan which is my english name. I was born in Fujian Province and was graduated from Tianjin University with the major of Computer Engeering Management. 
# 过往工作
I have about ten years of work experience and been engaged in full-stack development and design. During this period,  I have done dozens of large or small projects. Before Nodejs and react became popular in China, my previous jobs are based on mvc or mvvm. Mainly javascript and .net. 
# 穆迪业务
My recent job was at Moody's, which is one of the world's three major rating agencies, providing credit ratings, research, tools and analysis for global capital markets.
Our specific business lines are divided into trend analysis, reports, financials, ratings, etc. I work as Teach leader in Content department which includes about 150 people in Shenzhen, half of them are developers.
# 穆迪职责
My responsibility is to participate in the architecture design and optimization of the new platform which was evolved from a legacy system. I should resolve the technical difficulties and did some related POC and technical selection. As a tech leader, I should also guide and coordinate the team work to ensure the progress. But most of my work is still in the coding of core functions and modules.
# 细化工作
In the first three years in Moodys, my job was about the front-end infrastructure of the new platform, like establishing the website and its basic information and setting up the common component library for  the internal sharing. Then, my core work was about backedn development like microservices development, CMS and search engine. In the latest 1 or 2 years, I focus on business development and responsible for two business lines, rating and financils which are the core modules in Moodys.
# 做过的项目
## Neptune
There are about 6 project I did in Moodys. the first one is Neptune which is component library like MaterialUI, AntDesign, providing reusable and unified components for the whole department. The reason why we need to create this project is because our requirements of data visualization are more complicated and should be supported by customize components. 
my responsibilty for this job is to setup its server side and create some comopnents like button, grid, table and so on.
The technical stack includes React, Webpack, Cypress as E2E test etc.
## CV2
Other front-end projects are about business, like rating and financial. They are mainly about data visualization to meet the requirements of our strategies. For example, we wil provide customers with historical rating reports of various banks and corporates, as well as predictable future rating trends, to help them making corresponding decisions.
The technical stack is full-stack, like React for front-end and NodeJS, C#, golang for basic service development.
# Backend
1. 
For the backednd projects I did, the first one in mass data migration and service. The reason why we developed this service is because it is one of the busiest service which can be called from hundreds of micorservices. So it requires high concurrent ablity and the response time should be lower than 10 milliseconds. I migrated the data from mongoDB to Redis cluster in AWS elasticache by using golang to make sure it can meet the intensive calculation and provide the Restful and gRPC service.
The technical stack includes Golang, MongoDB, Redis Cluster, Kafka, Docker
2. the second project is CMS customized development by using sharepoint and sitecore
3. the last one is search engine by using fusion which is based on solr. It provides search service for thie platform. and I also did some POC for elasticsearch.
